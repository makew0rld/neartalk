        <h1>About NearTalk</h1>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
        NearTalk is chat platform to talk to people nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyone with the same IP address is in the same chat room. For example, everyone
        in your house will get the same chat room if they visit NearTalk. If you go to
        your local coffee shop, everyone who visits NearTalk will be in the same chat room.
        This extends to larger organizations like college/university campuses.
        </p>
        <p>
        Depending on how the network is set up, all mobile devices using data with the same
        network provider as you may be chatting together. Or similarly, all the other homes
        using the same ISP. This is the minority of cases however.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it?</h2>
        <p>
        For fun, mostly. I wanted to make a chat application and I wanted to use
        <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, and this seemed like a fun idea.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are many reasons why NearTalk isn't useful, and talking to your fellow humans
        face to face
        is much better. However there are a few times when having a local chatroom is useful,
        like for discussing (or dragging) a presentation going on. At the end of the day,
        I'm happy to have made something.
        </p>
        <h2>How do I change my nickname?</h2>
        <p>
        Send this special message: <code>/nick my-new-nickname</code><br />
        It will go away when you reload the page.
        </p>
