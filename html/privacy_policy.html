        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
        NearTalk is intended to be a privacy-preserving service.
        Your data is yours, and I don't want it.
        </p>
        <p>
        No data is retained long term. If the service experiences abuse I may turn on HTTP logging,
        meaning IP addresses, user agents, and times when the site was visited would be available to me.
        Currently, even that is not turned on, so no data is retained.
        </p>
        <p>
        The content of messages is never stored anywhere. It is removed from the server RAM as soon as
        the message has be sent to all users in the chat room.
        </p>
        <p>
        As server admin, I can ONLY see:
        <ul>
            <li>IP addresses</li>
            <li>Number of chat rooms</li>
            <li>When the last message was sent in each room</li>
        </ul>
        Nothing else is available to me, by design, and none of this is saved permanently.
        </p>
